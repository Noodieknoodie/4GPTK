#### Client Selection  
- If the client is active, display their `client_id` and `display_name`, sorted alphabetically.  

#### Provider-Based Grouping  
- If a contract exists for a client, include the `provider_name`.  
- Otherwise, list the client without a provider.  

### Client Dashboard Cards  

#### Contract Details  
- If `contract_number` exists, display it. Otherwise, show "N/A".  
- Display `provider_name`.  
- If `payment_schedule` is "monthly," show "Monthly"; otherwise, show "Quarterly".  
- If `fee_type` is "flat," show "Flat Rate"; otherwise, show "Percentage of AUM".  

#### Fee Amount / Percentage  
- If `fee_type` is "flat," display `flat_rate`.  
- If `fee_type` is "percentage," adjust `percent_rate` based on `payment_schedule`:  
  - Monthly: Use `percent_rate` as-is.  
  - Quarterly: Multiply by 3 for annual equivalence.  

#### Payment Information  
- If `last_recorded_assets` exists, display its value; otherwise, show "No AUM data available".  
- If `fee_type` is "flat`, use `flat_rate`.  
- If `fee_type` is "percentage` and `last_recorded_assets` exists, multiply by `percent_rate`.  
- If `last_recorded_assets` is missing but `last_payment_amount` exists, use that as a fallback.  
- If no data exists, show "N/A".  
- Display `last_payment_date`.  
- If `last_payment_amount` exists, display it; otherwise, show "N/A".  
- Calculate `next_payment_due`:  
  - If `last_payment_date` exists, add one month for monthly payments or three months for quarterly.  
  - If no payment history exists, show today's date.  

### Compliance Status  
- If no payment exists, status is "red" with reason "No payment records found".  
- If `payment_schedule` is monthly:  
  - Within 45 days: "green" (recent payment).  
  - 45-75 days: "yellow" (approaching due).  
  - Over 75 days: "red" (overdue).  
- If `payment_schedule` is quarterly:  
  - Within 135 days: "green".  
  - 135-195 days: "yellow".  
  - Over 195 days: "red".  

### Payment Form Logic  

#### Available Periods  
- If `payment_schedule` is "monthly," generate all months from contract start date to the present.  
- If "quarterly," generate quarters instead.  

#### Expected Fee Calculation  
- If `fee_type` is "flat," use `flat_rate`.  
- If "percentage," multiply `percent_rate` by `last_recorded_assets` if available.  
- If no AUM data exists, fallback to "Percentage fee (assets not provided)".  

#### Payment Creation  
- Store `contract_id`, `client_id`, `received_date`, `total_assets`, `expected_fee`, and `actual_fee`.  
- If "monthly," store applied start and end months.  
- If "quarterly," store applied start and end quarters.  

#### Split Payments Validation  
- If a split payment is used, ensure `end_period` is not before `start_period`.  

### Payment History  

#### Display  
- List all payments linked to a client, sorted by `received_date`.  

#### Split Payment Handling  
- If spanning multiple quarters or months, calculate the total periods and distribute `actual_fee` evenly.  

#### Payment Variance Calculation  
- If expected fee is missing but AUM data exists, calculate `expected_fee = total_assets * percent_rate`.  
- Compare `actual_fee` to `expected_fee`:  
  - If exact, mark "Exact Match".  
  - If within 5%, mark "✓".  
  - If within 15%, mark "warning".  
  - If over 15%, mark "alert".  

### File Management  

#### Client Directory  
- If `onedrive_folder_path` exists, use it. Otherwise, assign a default path.  

#### File Storage  
- Store payment-related files in a `Consulting Fee/{year}` folder, creating it if necessary.  
- Prevent filename conflicts by appending a timestamp if needed.  
- Record stored file paths in the database.  

#### Payment-File Association  
- Link or unlink files from payments.  
- Prevent deletion if a file is linked to payments.
